# AccelDedup  
**AccelDedup** is a robust, cloud-based solution designed to address the challenges of data redundancy in storage management. By utilizing cutting-edge deduplication techniques, AccelDedup optimizes data storage, enhances system performance, and reduces costs.  

---

## Key Technologies  

- **Frontend**: React.js, HTML, CSS, Material-UI/Bootstrap  
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js  
- **Cloud Services**: AWS (S3 for storage, SDK for integration)  
- **Middleware**: Multer for file uploads  
- **Hashing Algorithms**: SHA-256 for file integrity and deduplication  
- **Database**: Supports metadata storage for optimized data handling  

---

## Features  

1. **Comprehensive Deduplication**  
   - Handles deduplication at file, block, and application levels.  

2. **Real-Time Processing**  
   - Detects and eliminates duplicates as data is uploaded.  

3. **Cloud-Native Integration**  
   - Seamless integration with AWS S3 and support for other platforms like Google Cloud and Azure.  

4. **Enhanced Performance**  
   - Reduces storage demands, improves data retrieval speeds, and enhances system efficiency.  

5. **User-Friendly Interface**  
   - React.js-powered intuitive dashboard for uploads, monitoring, and reporting.  

6. **Scalability**  
   - Designed for growing data volumes, suitable for both small businesses and large enterprises.  

7. **Advanced Security**  
   - Implements encryption for data at rest and in transit, secure authentication, and role-based access control.

## How It Works  

AccelDedup uses the following workflow:  

1. **File Upload**  
   - Users upload files through a responsive web interface.  

2. **Hash Generation**  
   - Each file is processed with SHA-256 to generate a unique hash for identification.  

3. **Duplicate Check**  
   - The system checks incoming hashes against stored records to identify duplicates.  

4. **Storage Optimization**  
   - Unique files are stored, while duplicates are replaced with references, saving storage space.  

5. **Reporting**  
   - Users receive detailed reports on storage usage and deduplication efficiency.
